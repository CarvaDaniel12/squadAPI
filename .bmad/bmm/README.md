##  Module Structure

This module contains:

```
bmm/
 agents/          # 12 specialized AI agents (PM, Architect, SM, DEV, TEA, etc.)
 workflows/       # 34 workflows across 4 phases + testing
 teams/           # Pre-configured agent groups
 tasks/           # Atomic work units
 testarch/        # Comprehensive testing infrastructure
 docs/            # Complete user documentation
```

### Agent Roster

**Core Development:** PM, Analyst, Architect, SM, DEV, TEA, UX Designer, Technical Writer
**Game Development:** Game Designer, Game Developer, Game Architect
**Orchestration:** BMad Master (from Core)

 **[Full Agents Guide](./docs/agents-guide.md)** - Roles, workflows, and when to use each agent

### Workflow Phases

**Phase 0:** Documentation (brownfield only)
**Phase 1:** Analysis (optional) - 5 workflows
**Phase 2:** Planning (required) - 6 workflows
**Phase 3:** Solutioning (Level 3-4) - 2 workflows
**Phase 4:** Implementation (iterative) - 10 workflows
**Testing:** Quality assurance (parallel) - 9 workflows

 **[Workflow Guides](./docs/README.md#-workflow-guides)** - Detailed documentation for each phase

##  Getting Started

**New Project:**

```bash
# Install BMM
npx bmad-method@alpha install

# Load Analyst agent in your IDE, then:
*workflow-init
```

**Existing Project (Brownfield):**

```bash
# Document your codebase first
*document-project

# Then initialize
*workflow-init
```

 **[Quick Start Guide](./docs/quick-start.md)** - Complete setup and first project walkthrough

##  Key Concepts

### Scale-Adaptive Design

BMM automatically adjusts to project complexity (Levels 0-4):

- **Level 0-1:** Quick Spec Flow for bug fixes and small features
- **Level 2:** PRD with optional architecture
- **Level 3-4:** Full PRD + comprehensive architecture

 **[Scale Adaptive System](./docs/scale-adaptive-system.md)** - Complete level breakdown

### Story-Centric Implementation

Stories move through a defined lifecycle: `backlog  drafted  ready  in-progress  review  done`

Just-in-time epic context and story context provide exact expertise when needed.

 **[Implementation Workflows](./docs/workflows-implementation.md)** - Complete story lifecycle guide

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Use party mode to engage all 19+ agents (from BMM, CIS, BMB, custom modules) in group discussions for strategic decisions, creative brainstorming, and complex problem-solving.
