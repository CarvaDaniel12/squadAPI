# Agent-to-Provider Routing Configuration
# Maps each agent to optimal provider based on task characteristics

# Routing strategy:
# - Boss tier (complex reasoning) → Groq (Llama-3.3-70B)
# - Worker tier (fast tasks) → Cerebras (Llama-3.1-8B)
# - Creative tasks → Gemini (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
# - Fallback/diversity → OpenRouter (Auto-routing)

# BOSS TIER - Complex reasoning, high quality
analyst:
  primary: groq              # Mary needs deep reasoning (requirements analysis)
  fallback: [gemini, cerebras, openrouter]

architect:
  primary: groq              # Winston needs technical depth (system design)
  fallback: [gemini, cerebras, openrouter]

pm:
  primary: groq              # John needs strategic thinking (product planning)
  fallback: [gemini, cerebras, openrouter]

# WORKER TIER - Fast execution, high throughput
dev:
  primary: cerebras          # Amelia needs speed (code generation)
  fallback: [groq, gemini, openrouter]

tea:
  primary: cerebras          # Murat needs speed (test generation)
  fallback: [groq, gemini, openrouter]

# CREATIVE TIER - Multimodal, creative tasks
'tech writer':
  primary: gemini            # Paige benefits from Gemini's writing capability
  fallback: [groq, cerebras, openrouter]

'ux designer':
  primary: gemini            # Sally needs creative reasoning
  fallback: [groq, cerebras, openrouter]

# BALANCED TIER - Sprint management, coordination
sm:
  primary: cerebras          # Bob needs fast responses for sprint coordination
  fallback: [groq, gemini, openrouter]

# Default routing (if agent not specified above)
default:
  primary: groq
  fallback: [cerebras, gemini, openrouter]

# Load balancing strategy
load_balancing:
  enabled: true
  algorithm: round_robin  # Options: round_robin, least_latency, least_load
  
# Provider tier classification
tiers:
  boss:
    providers: [groq]
    agents: [analyst, architect, pm]
    
  worker:
    providers: [cerebras]
    agents: [dev, tea, sm]
    
  creative:
    providers: [gemini]
    agents: [tech-writer, ux-designer]
    
  fallback:
    providers: [openrouter]
    agents: []  # Available for all as fallback
